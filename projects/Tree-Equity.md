I worked in The State of Hawaii's Kaulunani Division of Urban Forestry, writing a 50+ page report on green infrastructure equity in Honolulu. To do this, I used Kaulunani's list of publicly held trees in order to project the monetary value of urban trees across Honolulu. Forther, this project used monetary value of trees, canopy cover data, and demographic indicators from the CDC to create a portrait of Urban Tree Equity in Honolulu. Canopy Cover data I created was the first of its kind for Honolulu County. 
In the course of this project, I used ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online, iTree Canopy, SciDAVis, and iTree Eco.
