I started asking for piano lessons, when I was four, and I haven't stopped playing since. While I still have loads to learn, I've managed to come a long way, and am proud of my journey. My most trying project so far has been learning Frederik Chopin's Fantasie Impromtu. It is a four and a half minute piece, regarded as one of his most difficult. This difficulty is largely due to the rapid tempo, and the extreme dynamic and keyboard range required. Bringing this difficulty to a crescendo--large sections of the piece have completely different left and right hand rythms.

I spent over three and a half years on the piece, but can now call it finished.
