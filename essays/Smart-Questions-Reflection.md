"How to ask questions the smart way" is not an article I'd read before. The most valuable information I gleaned from it related to hacker culture, and how talking about tech on the internet requires a knowledge of this culture's beliefs and values. Furthermore, if you're phrasing questions on online message boards it's important to know whose time you're using, what they want to work on, and how to avoid being rude. Hacker politeness does not revolve around niceties, but instead around the search for truth. If they think you're honestly searching for a specific answer and have already given the problem your best shot, someone on the forums is likely to help you. If a hacker can learn something interesting from your question, they'll stick around and maybe figure it out, or at least watch the show. If it's not interesting and potentially informative, they won't. 
 
Perhaps due to content moderation standards on Stack overflow being stricter than they were in the past, I can't find any bad questions. This was in spite of searching by some potentially useful keywords ("help," "broken," "bug," etc.), sorting for the least upvoted threads of all time, and checking any unverified answers I came across. The questions I did encounter made it clear that the poster had done their research and was at least somewhat well-informed about tech (at least to my novice eyes). There were no comments or questions to which one could fairly reply "RTFM." The problems posed were specific and nontrivial.
