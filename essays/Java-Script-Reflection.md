I really enjoyed our module on JavaScript. While I hadn't ever used it before, I was still able to do our beginning exercises with relative ease, and it helped me to warm up my coding abilities for the semester. This is especially promising because it's been over two years since I've coded. 

I didn't have any serious problems with the way the language is designed. The biggest obstacle was not requiring function names, as well as arrow function notation. These were completely new to me, and weren't really things I knew were possible. The big problem with them though was that I don't really see how they work. How can a function be run by the computer if it doesn't have a declared name? Can it be re-referenced? I have no idea.

I liked the lack of strong typing in JavaScript, it was a little bit less to remember. I don't mean that weak typing allowed me to slack off more, but that I didn't exactly remember the proper uses of void, int, string, and other C type keywords. I found JavaScript to be more similar to python than C. I have experience in Java, but it came from taking courses online over the summer, so the material didn't sink in as much. I still somewhat struggle with running functions by appending them to the end of objects (e.g. object.length()). I'm not even sure the previous example is correct.

I think JavaScript is a reasonably good programming language, but don't think I'm qualified to have an opinion. One of my favorite authors is Paul Graham, and he seems to think that regular Java (I'm not sure about JavaScript) is generally a mediocre language because it was developed by institutional programmers trying to prevent user error. In other words, his complaint is that it was designed by people who didn't plan to use it. He compares this to two other programming languages he considers good: C and LISP, which were both invented by people that intended to use them. He has some short essays on software language design that I find fascinating.

Changing gears, athletic software engineering is really appealing to me. It seems like a fast way to learn material well. I find practice WODs useful, and I think that this style of learning is more akin to the kind of learning that happens on the job and as the result of working on interesting projects, which I think is the most authentic kind. Of course, it also has the benefit of classroom-style instruction, where we are being instructed by people who actually know the answers and are able to lean on expertise instead of simply shrugging and thinking to ourselves: "I guess this works."

The practice WODs can be stressful, but that is part of what's appealing about them. As a person who struggles with studying but enjoys learning interesting things in situations with stakes, the WODs are perfect. I think the class setup will work as well for me as anything ever has. Does that mean it will work? I hope so.

As of 1/30/24 -- There's another cool thing we've learned how to do in JavaScript--publish updates to our websites using GitHub Desktop.
