I'm interested in software engineering as a way to solve problems, and as a way to think more clearly. The problems I care about are primarily environmental in nature--I started Natural Resources and Environmental Management before Computer Science. But if therre was one thing that working on environmental problems taught me, it's that programming and problem solving skills are at an immense premium in the field. Very few people have legitimate field and computer science skills. As geographic information systems become more and more powerful, and computer systems and artificial intelligence grow more and more capable of solving complex environmental problems, I expect the demand in the natural sciences to only grow.

That said, I'm not merely learning for a job. I'm learning in order to be capable, and in order to solve problems that interest me. Of course, I will have to parlay this ability to solve problems into an ability to not starve. On the whole though, I'm most interested in having a field job where I can solve problems that matter to myself and others. Hopefully I can "make the world a better place," "focus on the journey, not the destination," and live by any other number of despicably true platitudes. 

As for the concrete skills I would like to build, I would like to become proficient in LISP, and to become adept at modelling complex systems. My dream, if I could do anything at all in the world, is to write programs that, given basic starting conditions, could run and give outputs similar to portions of our own world. If you gave it the island of Oahu 2 million years ago, it would produce the island of Oahu today. (Or at least another possible future.) 

Why would this matter? Because A program like that might allow us to remedy serious problems. Maybe we can't restore a resource to its pre-interference state, but perhaps we could restore it to a state that might have been reached naturally, given microscopically different starting conditions several thousand years ago.  I know it's a far off dream. It's complex, it's involved. But it's what I want. For now, I'll settle on turning my assignments in on time.
